#Rules of a race

During a race, your team follows the standard rules of flamme rouge, using 2 decks of cards. One is for your rider, the other is for your 2 teammates.

##Starting positions

Randomly select a team that place one of its riders. Do that again until all riders have been placed.

Your opponents always place their riders as close as possible to the start line, and on the right lane if both are empty. However, you decide for them if it is Sprinteur or Rouleur that is placed first.

## The Opponents

Your opponents are not like you. On some races, they can be surprisingly strong and simply fall apart on another one. They are unpredictable. You will have to deal with it and try to get ahead in the long run.

You play against 3 teams of a Rouleur and a Sprinteur. Don't use decks for them. In the Energy Phase, they do nothing. During the Movement Phase, to move a rider, roll a die.
- Rouleur: Add 2 to the result
- Sprinteur: Between 1 and 5 -> Add 1 to the result ; On a 6 -> get 10

Then, act like this opponent had played a card of this value. Apply as usual the rules for ascent, descent...
Warning: You will notice that your opponents have better results than you in average. You will have to play smart to compensate.

Your opponents follow the standard rules during the End Phase, but they just ignore the exhaustion cards they should receive.

Tip: You can speed up the Movement phase if you use colored dice. For example, if the black rouleur is followed by the blue sprinteur and the red sprinteur, you can roll a black die, a blue die and a red die together and then move the 3 riders.

## Your teammates

During the Energy Phase, consider your teammates as a second rider. As in the original game, you choose if you start with your main rider or with your teammates.

When you pick cards for your teammates, draw 6 from the deck. You have to choose 2 among these 6. Recycle the others as usual.
During the Movement Phase, when a teammate should move, pick one of the 2 cards. When the second teammate should move, pick the other card. Both cards are removed during the End Phase.

When you have 3 cards or less in the teammates deck, then you only pick one and you remove one of your 2 teammates from the track. He has done its best but will not be able to help your main rider for the rest of the race.Â Your other teammate will be alone for 3 turns before giving up.

During the End Phase, the teammates follow standard rules to apply slipstreaming and exhaustion. However, THE TEAMMATES NEVER TAKE EXHAUSTION CARDS.

The teammates cannot get tour points to the team, and they don't participate in rankings for any maillot. Don't track their time. Ignore them. For example, if a teammate finish second in a race, the 2 points for the second place will be awarded to the next rider finishing.

## End of the race

As in a Grand Tour, keep playing until all the riders (except the teammates) have arrived, to track their time.
