# Tour rules

The game is played as a Grand Tour (see the Flamme Rouge variant "Grand Tour" rules), composed of 5 races. Along the races, you will track the time ranking and the tour points won by your main rider.

## Rules adaptation

In this game, you don't remove exhaustion cards from your deck between races.

Also, you will start the game with a base handicap of 2 exhaustion cards. You can decide to adapt this number for your next games for more challenge.

## Talents

Your rider is unique and will show his talents all along the tour! You will pick talents depending on the rider you chose. There are 3 talent levels.

Before the 1st race -> Pick a level 1 talent  
Before the 3rd race -> Pick a level 2 talent  
Before the 5th race -> Pick a level 3 talent  

So you will play your 5th (last) race cumulating the advantages of 3 talents!
The talents are listed after for each type of rider.

## Stages

Before starting the tour, set the 5 stages of the tour at random. You can draw 5 stages cards, or use any other mean to generate 5 stages. Use that knowledge to pick well your talents!

The stages are going to be harder and harder during the tour. You have to modify the stages by adding track tiles.  
From the 2nd stage: Add a random straight tile right after the start tile.  
From the 4th stage: Add also a random straight tile right before the end tile.

Logistic: If you don't have the peloton expansion, use a tile of the stage that you will put back in place when the riders have crossed it (or the opposite for the tile next to the finish line).

## Points

For each stage, you will earn tour points if you finish in the 3 best positions:
- 1st -> 3 points
- 2nd -> 2 points
- 3rd -> 1 point

At the end of the tour, you will earn points depending on your position on the time tracking ranking:
- 1st -> 5 points
- 2nd -> 4 points
- 3rd -> 3 points
- 4th -> 2 points
- 5th -> 1 point

For each rider, an introduction campaign can add some score rules, and introduce other maillots than the 'maillot jaune'. When these rules are mastered, you can mix them all with any rider
