# Variants

Keep track of your scores separately for each variant and for the standard game.

## 6th stage

In this variant, you play a 6th stage, following the same rules as for the 5th stage. It allows you to use the combination of your 3 talents for 2 races.

## Express Tour

In this variant, you play a grand tour of only 3 stages. Pick a talent before each stage. Increase the length of the 2nd stage of one tile, and the 3rd stage of two tiles as explained in the tour rules.
