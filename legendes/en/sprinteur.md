# The Sprinteur

Starting deck: standard rouleur. 3 cards of each value (2, 3, 4, 5, 9)

## Introduction Campaign
In every race there will be a intermediate sprint. Put a mark right before the end of the largest portion without ascent that doesn't lead to the finish line. If there is no ascent at all, put the mark at the middle of the track. If your rider is the first to cross the mark, you score one tour point.

## Talents

### Level 1

- **A bit more**: Once in the race, during the movement phase, add 1 to your card value.
- **Breakaway**: If you start your turn on the front line of your pack (left or right), you don't give slipstreaming this turn.
- **Clarity**: You always draw 5 cards instead of 4


### Level 2

- **Super sprint**: Your 9 are 12
- **Mountain sprint**: Your 9 make you move 7 in ascents
- **Descent sprint**: If you play a 9 in a blue zone, add a 5 (descent) or a 4 (supply zone) to your recycled cards.


### Level 3

- **Tactical team**: Your teammates always choose their cards from the whole deck
- **Until the end**: Add 5 cards (one of each) to your teammates deck
- **Final stretch**: When you pick this talent, remove all the exhaustion cards from your deck

## Precisions

"Mountain sprint" increases the limitation of ascent to 7 for you in the turns when you play a 9. It applies to any case when the ascent would slow you down (starting in ascent, going across any red square...).

"Descent sprint" applies in descents and supply zones. If you play a 9 in descent, you add a 5 to your recycled cards. If you play a 9 in supply zone, you add a 4 to your recycled cards. The card added comes from the unused cards of the game. It will be removed from your deck at the end of the race.

"Final stretch" only applies once, when you pick it up.
