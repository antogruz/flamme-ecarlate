# The Rouleur

Starting deck: standard rouleur. 3 cards of each value (3,4,5,6,7)

## Introduction Campaign
Play a standard Grand Tour as described in these rules, with this modifier: The points awarded for the General Classification (Time tracking) are doubled

## Talents

### Level 1

- Power save: You can always decide to play no card and to 'do 3'. You recycle the 4 cards in this case.
- Stamina: Your exhaustion cards value is now 3
- Second breath: Between races, remove 3 exhaustion cards from your deck

### Level 2

- Rest: If you are moving forward the minimum value in descent (5) or in supply zone (4), get back a card already played and recycle it
- Breakaway racer: If you start your turn in a pack of less than half of the riders, add 1 to the value of your card.
- Chasing racer: If you start your turn not in the first pack, add 1 to the value of your card.


### Level 3

- Roule, Roule: Add a card 7 to your deck
- Specialization Sprinteur: Your cards 7 do 9
- Specialization climber: You can move up to 7 in ascents


## Precisions

The talent "Rest" is activated when you move forward the minimum value in descent or in supply zone. So, if you play a card of value 2, 3, 4, or 5 in descent, or a card of value 2, 3, or 4 in a supply zone. In this case you pick a card that you played before (or even at this turn) and you recycle it.

The talents "Breakaway racer" and "Chasing racer" are applied if the conditions are true at the beginning of the turn. In this case, you are still constraint by the ascents. A 5 increased by 1 is becoming a 6, but if you are in an ascent you will move forward 5 only. A 2 increased by 1 becomes a 3, but if you are in a supply zone you will move forward 4 as usual.
If you have the talent "stamina", playing an exhaustion card increased by 1 makes you move forward 4.
If you have the talent "Specialization Sprinteur" and you play a 6 increased by 1, you only move forward 7 (and not 9).
